# Notify the user anytime the search returns results
# Search results need to be formatted, not raw json

# Thought Process:
# User defines what item they want to search and be notified about
# User specifies specific details for the search: Keyword, price range, distance, etc.

# The app will run every X amount of time, perform the search, and notify the user
# If new listings available, notify the user with the details of the listing
# If no new listings, notify user that no new listings were found

# User will be notified via telegram bot, or email - Undecided (TODO)
