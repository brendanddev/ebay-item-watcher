---- App Workflow ----

1. User Input & Configuration
    - User defines search criteria
        ➼ Keywords (e.g., Secret Wars, Infinity Gauntlet, etc)
        ➼ Price range 
        ➼ Location based filters
    - User sets notification method
        ➼ Telegram bot
        ➼ Email

2. Scheduled Execution
    - App runs on fixed interval
    - Scheduling tools like schedule, cron, or manual loops

3. Perform Search
    - Calls eBay browse API with specified search params
    - Parses the response, filters the result, and formats response

4. Notification Logic
    - If new listings are found:
        ➼ Format relevant details (title, price, link, etc)
        ➼ Send a formatted message via notification method specified by user
    - If no new listings are found: 
        ➼ Optionally notify user

5. Repeat
    - Loop continues as long as app is running or scheduled




# Notify the user anytime the search returns results
# Search results need to be formatted, not raw json

# Thought Process:
# User defines what item they want to search and be notified about
# User specifies specific details for the search: Keyword, price range, distance, etc.

# The app will run every X amount of time, perform the search, and notify the user
# If new listings available, notify the user with the details of the listing
# If no new listings, notify user that no new listings were found

# User will be notified via telegram bot, or email - Undecided (TODO)
